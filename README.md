# Improved U-Nets with Inception Blocks for Building Detection
This repository consists Inception Unet versions of classical Unet architecture for image segmentation. 
In the paper, a new deep learning architecture has been developed by combining inception blocks with the convolutional layers 
of the original U-Net architecture to achieve remarkably high performance in building detection. 

You can train your model by using **[Massachusetts Buildings Dataset]** https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/data/
